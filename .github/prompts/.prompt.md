# Agent Guidelines
These are the rules and constraints that the agent should follow while completeing the task

* Respect the existing file structure and code style. we create components that are used by a specific page in the _components folder, so it is important to keep this in mind when creating new components. Otherwise, components that are reused may be stored in the components folder.

* solve the root of the problem, not the symptoms

##Guidelines specific to this project
This is a Game Design Document writing app similar to Notion. It's made in Node.js and React. We use Blocknote for the document writing functionality - it's based on TipTap but stores the document data in blocks.
It heavily relies on shadcn-ui components, so we should follow their guidelines as well.
