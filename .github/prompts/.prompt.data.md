# Agent Guidelines - Data
One key feature of this text editor is that you can pull little cards with game mechanics or other game elements into your document and thus tag your project. The data about the game mechanics is stored in a Supabase database, which is then used to generate the game mechanics card.

Here is an example entry from the database:
Name	Symbol	Category	Short Description	Long Description	Examples	Solved Problems	Min Time	Max Time	Time to Implement (Explained)
Adaptive AI	AaI	AI	Dynamic adjustment of AI behaviour & difficulty.	Adjust enemy behavior dynamically based on player performance and other metrics. Notable in games like Left 4 Dead.	Left 4 Dead: Famous for balancing difficulty of combat based on how well the player is faring against them.; Alien: Isolation: An AI director ensured the primary antagonist of the game never gets too far from the player.	The game getting boring because of a static AI system.	40 hours	3 months	The minimum implementation, a basic adaptive AI, could be achieved in roughly 40 hours by focusing on a single, easily measurable metric like player deaths or damage taken, and adjusting enemy aggression or spawn rates accordingly. This would involve scripting a simple system to track performance and modify AI parameters. The worst-case scenario, aiming for a sophisticated system akin to Left 4 Dead's Director or Alien: Isolation's AI director, could take up to 3 months. This would require extensive data collection and analysis to identify meaningful performance indicators, complex algorithms to dynamically adjust multiple AI behaviors (movement, attack patterns, resource allocation), robust testing and iteration, and potentially integration with existing game systems like pathfinding and combat logic, all while ensuring the AI remains challenging and engaging without feeling unfair or predictable. * Respect the existing file structure and code style. we create components that are used by a specific page in the _components folder, so it is important to keep this in mind when creating new components. Otherwise, components that are reused may be stored in the components folder.
